Puzzle 5: Machine Learning Loss Function

As Machine Learning becomes ubiquitous, it's a powerful tool that is used to for many things. Amongst them are classification, categorization, clustering, and regression. 

The "algorithm" that helps to achieve this is called a Model. It is imperative to test the accuracy of a model before it is deployed. To test the accuracy of a model, a Loss Function is applied. What a loss function does is to calculate the sum of the difference between the output of the model and what is expected. 

For example, say a model is defined as f(.). When the model is applied to an input x, the output is y'. Also, say the expected output is y. 

The loss function will calculate the âˆ‘ ((y-y') ^ 2) for all the input data being used for test.

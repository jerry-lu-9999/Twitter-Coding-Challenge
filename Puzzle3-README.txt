Puzzle #3: Text Processing

Twitter users TWEET! These 280-character documents are small but powerful especially
when you look at ALL the tweets as a large collection.  In order to analyze all of
this tweet data we need software that knows how to examine and gather information from
the tweets.

One of the most common and simple analysis software can do is counting words.
The frequency of a word might indicate that it is important. An example of this
might be the word "election" being used in many tweets.  This might indicate
that the topic of an upcoming election is trending.

In this exercise you can use JavaDoc to research which Java libraries to use
to solve the coding problem.

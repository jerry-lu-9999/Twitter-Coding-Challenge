Puzzle #1: Huffman Encoding

Simplified Huffman Encoding

Huffman Encoding enables data to be stored in 1's and 0's.
The 1's and 0's can then be reduced to bytes.  This encoding is an example of data compression.

Encoding and decoding is based on a binary tree structure.
  0 <- go left
  1 <- go right

Keep going left and right until you get to a leaf.  The value in the leaf is the decoded
symbol.

Fill in the missing pieces of Java code.  The answers will be the solution to
the puzzle.

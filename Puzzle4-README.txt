Puzzle #4: Matrix Mathematics

Matrix mathematics has applications in mathematicians, science and engineering.
You can represent groups of equations as matrices and then have a systematic way of
doing the math. Computers have embedded matrix arithmetic in graphic processing algorithms
to render reflection and refraction. Some properties of matrix mathematics are important in
graph theory and statistics.

There are some common operations you can do on matrices.

Two matrices may be added or subtracted only if they have the same dimensions.

Addition or subtraction is accomplished by adding or subtracting corresponding elements.

EXAMPLE:

A = 1 2
    3 4

B = 1 2
    3 4

ADDITION:

A + B = 
1+1   2+2
3+3   4+4
 =    	
2  4
6  8

SUBTRACTION:

A - B = 
1-1   2-2
3-3   4-4
 =    	
0  0
0  0

TRANSPOSING:

To "transpose" a matrix, swap the rows and columns.

A = 1 2
    3 4

Transpose A =
1 3
2 4
